**Hall Model**

Created for the US Department of State. One of the first afforts towards IC.

It explains how communication differs between cultures:

- Hight context vs low context
- Time perception (polychronic vs monochronnic)
- Space perception (high territoriality vs lowterritoriality)


| Hight Context           | Low Context          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Nonverbal communication | Verbal communication |
| Implied meaning         | Literal Meaning      |
| Indirect communication  | Direct communication |

| Polychronic                                                            | Monochronic                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multitasking, Relationship oriented, Flexible schedules, Interruptions | Sequential Tasking, Schedule-oriented, Punctual, Time as resource |

| Low Territoriality                                                | Hight Territoriality                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Shared Resources, Flexibility, Less Emotional Attachemen to Space | Clear Boundaries, Ownership and Control, Defensiveness |

**Hofstede Model**

Consists of multiple dimensions of national culture:

1. Power Distance (PDI)
2. Individualism/collectivism (IDV)
3. Masculinity/Femininity (MAS)
4. Uncertainty avoidance (UAI)
5. Long Term Orientation (LTO)
6. Indulgence / Restraint (IND)

**The Lewis Model**

Three main categories :

1. Linear-active Cultures
2. Multi-active Cultures
3. Reactive or Listening Cultures

Linear-active cultures: (Germany, Switzerland, UK, US, Scandinavia)

- Task-oriented
- Highly organised planners who complete action-chains by doing one thing at a time, with a linear agenda
- Direct discussion, sticking to facts and figures from reliable, written sources
- Speech is for information exchange and they talk and listen in equal proportions
- Truthful rather than diplomatic and do not fear confrontation
- Sticking to logic rather than emotions
- Partly conceal feelings and value a certain amount of privacy
- Results-oriented and like to move quickly forward, compromising when necessary to achieve a deal

Multi-active cultures: (Spain, Latin America, Middle East, India)

- Talkative, impulsive types who attach great importance to feelings, relationships and people-orientation
- Like to do many things at the same time and are tend to feel confined by agendas
- Conversation is roundabout and animated and they try to speak and listen at the same time
- Interruptions are frequent, pauses in conversation are few
- Are uncomfortable with silence and seldom permit or experience it
- Are late with delivery dates and when paying for services or goods received
- Procrastination is common, unpunctuality frequent
- Their concepts of time and discourse are decidedly non-linear and are amused or bewildered by the importance that timetables have for linear-active people

Reactive cultures: (Japan, South Kora, Vietnam, China, Thailand)

- Rarely initiate action or discussion, preferring first to listen to and establish the other’s position, then react to it and formulate their own
- They are the world’s best listeners and rarely, if ever, interrupt a speaker while the discourse/speech/presentation is going on
- Do not reply immediately. A decent period of silence after the speaker has stopped shows respect for the weight of the remarks
- Unlikely to voice any strong opinion immediately. A more probable tactic is to ask further questions on what has been said in order to clarify the speaker’s intent
