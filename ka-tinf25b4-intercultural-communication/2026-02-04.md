analyzing cultural differences.

- Cultural Awareness

Develop practical abilities to engage with and adapt to
cultural differences effectively.

- Intercultural Communication Skills
- Problem-Solving Skills
- Adaptability
- Negotiation Skills

Attitudes Dimension:

Objective: Cultivate a mindset that fosters respect, curiosity,
and collaboration across cultures

- Openness
- Empathy
- Tolerance for Ambiguity
- Cultural Curiosity

Its goal: Creating synergy between cultures:

- Move beyond differences to find strengths from both
- Recignizing diversity 

1. Identify Differences
2. Reconcile Differences
3. Integrate Strenghts

**Ting Toomey's work**

Emphasizes the importance of mindfulness, flexibility, and empathy in managing intercultural communication and conflict.

Mindfullness requeres individuals to:

- Observe differences without judgement
- Adapt behaviour to align with the values and norms of other cultures
- Recognize that cultural assumptions and biases can shape perceptions and reactions.

Face Negotiation Theory:

- Balancing self-oriented face-saving (preserving one’s dignity) with other-oriented face-giving (respecting and uplifting others’ dignity).
- Adapting communication strategies to align with cultural preferences for individualism or collectivism.

Flexible Intercultural Conflict Skills:

- Facework Management
- Mindful Listening
- Cultural Empathy
- Adaptive Code-Switching

All humans value the feeling of being respected, accepted, and acknowledged. Effective facework involves recognizing and addressing these universal needs:

- Face-Giving Behaviors: Focus on supporting others, affirming their dignity, and respecting their cultural values
- Face-Saving Behaviors: Aim to protect or restore one’s selfimage while avoiding aggressive or defensive reactions

Cultural Empathy:

- Perspective-Taking: Seeing the world through the other person’s cultural lens.
- Emotional Resonance: Responding with sensitivity to cultural cues and values.
- Behavioral Adaptation: Adjusting one’s actions to demonstrate respect and understanding.

Adaptive Code-switching:

- Modifying speech, tone, gestures, or behavior to align with the norms of the cultural context.
- Balancing authenticity with cultural sensitivity to foster positive interactions.
- Example: In a formal Japanese setting, one might adopt indirect language and respectful silence to align with cultural expectations of humility and harmony
