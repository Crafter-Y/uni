**Barmeyer / Ting Toomey**

key contribution: The development of a model for managing intercultural competencies

The Barmeyer Model Competence –Learning Model emphasizes the development of competencies that enable individuals to navigate and manage cultural differences effectively. It builds on three primary dimensions: Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes—often referred to as the KSA framework—and introduces strategies for fostering intercultural synergy:

Knowledge Dimension:

Build a foundation for recognizing and
analyzing cultural differences.

- Cultural Awareness
- Cultural Differences
- Cultural Frameworks

Skills Dimension:

Develop practical abilities to engage with and adapt to
cultural differences effectively.

- Intercultural Communication Skills
- Problem-Solving Skills
- Adaptability
- Negotiation Skills

Attitudes Dimension:

Objective: Cultivate a mindset that fosters respect, curiosity,
and collaboration across cultures

- Openness
- Empathy
- Tolerance for Ambiguity
- Cultural Curiosity

Its goal: Creating synergy between cultures:

- Move beyond differences to find strengths from both
- Recignizing diversity 

1. Identify Differences
2. Reconcile Differences
3. Integrate Strenghts

**Ting Toomey's work**

Emphasizes the importance of mindfulness, flexibility, and empathy in managing intercultural communication and conflict.

Mindfullness requeres individuals to:

- Observe differences without judgement
- Adapt behaviour to align with the values and norms of other cultures
- Recognize that cultural assumptions and biases can shape perceptions and reactions.

Face Negotiation Theory:

- Balancing self-oriented face-saving (preserving one’s dignity) with other-oriented face-giving (respecting and uplifting others’ dignity).
- Adapting communication strategies to align with cultural preferences for individualism or collectivism.

Flexible Intercultural Conflict Skills:

- Facework Management
- Mindful Listening
- Cultural Empathy
- Adaptive Code-Switching

All humans value the feeling of being respected, accepted, and acknowledged. Effective facework involves recognizing and addressing these universal needs:

- Face-Giving Behaviors: Focus on supporting others, affirming their dignity, and respecting their cultural values
- Face-Saving Behaviors: Aim to protect or restore one’s selfimage while avoiding aggressive or defensive reactions

Cultural Empathy:

- Perspective-Taking: Seeing the world through the other person’s cultural lens.
- Emotional Resonance: Responding with sensitivity to cultural cues and values.
- Behavioral Adaptation: Adjusting one’s actions to demonstrate respect and understanding.

Adaptive Code-switching:

- Modifying speech, tone, gestures, or behavior to align with the norms of the cultural context.
- Balancing authenticity with cultural sensitivity to foster positive interactions.
- Example: In a formal Japanese setting, one might adopt indirect language and respectful silence to align with cultural expectations of humility and harmony
