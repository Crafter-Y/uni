| Block 1 | I’m currently feeling quite confident with the topics presented, based on my communication with people of other cultures I had before. I do my communication based on what feels right in a given situation. All the knowledge I currently have is based on what I’ve come along. I have not dedicated any research towards IC yet. | I am curious what is exactly behind the presented topics. I am especially interested in differences that are not obvious or visible in plain sight. When to shake hands and when to avoid it is a kind of thing you need to be told to know it. Treating each other with respect sound basic, but there surely is more to it. |
