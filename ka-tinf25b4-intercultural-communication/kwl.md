| Block 1 | I’m currently feeling quite confident with the topics presented, based on my communication with people of other cultures I had before. I do my communication based on what feels right in a given situation. All the knowledge I currently have is based on what I’ve come along. I have not dedicated any research towards IC yet. | I am curious what is exactly behind the presented topics. I am especially interested in differences that are not obvious or visible in plain sight. When to shake hands and when to avoid it is a kind of thing you need to be told to know it. Treating each other with respect sound basic, but there surely is more to it.                                                                                         | I have now seen definitions for all these topics. We briefly went through the timeline of IC, starting in the 1940s. Milton Benett's model explains how intercultural competence it built up. We've done further research on how to measure cultural competence. On our second lecture, we learned about models like the iceberg, onion or bonsi tree to visualise what a culture means and consists of. We went deep into what visible/invisible parts of a culture might be. We've talked through stages of culture shock and how to overcome them. We've talked about barriers to communication, e.g. how high and low context in communication is recieved in different cultures. Lastly we've talked about generalization and stereotypes. If you observe or study a culture, you often form stereotypes, like Indians are always late. But you should rather form a generalization like: Punctionality in India may be viewed differently. |
| Block 2 | I have already heard of some of these models, but I know nothing in-depth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | I assume these models are similar to what we have learned already. I think they'll all have something to do with the steps to integrate into a new culture. I am somewhat interested in that. I hope this will prepare me to think more scientifically about how to interact with people in new cultures. I think these models will give me confidence beyond my intuition on how to interact with people and groups. | These models rather describe cultures by themselves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
